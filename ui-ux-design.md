# UI/UX Design Document: Genomics Results HL7 Sender

## 1. Introduction and Overview

**Design Philosophy**: The interface is designed for advanced users in a lab/office setting, prioritizing information density, control, and real-time visibility. It follows GDS (Government Digital Service) standards for accessibility, clarity, and consistency.

**User Experience Goals**:
- Empower users to monitor, configure, and troubleshoot the system efficiently
- Provide comprehensive, real-time system status and logs
- Minimize time to resolution for errors and issues
- Ensure compliance with accessibility and branding standards

**Design Approach**: Feature-rich dashboard with tabbed navigation, dense information layout, and advanced filtering/search. All critical system information and controls are accessible from a single interface.

**Success Metrics**:
- >99% of user actions completed without external help
- <2 minutes to identify and resolve common errors
- 100% GDS accessibility compliance

## 2. User Personas & Context

**Primary Persona**: Senior lab technician or bioinformatician, highly proficient with IT systems, responsible for monitoring and troubleshooting automated result delivery.

**Secondary Personas**: IT support staff, system administrators, clinicians (read-only access).

**Use Context**: Desktop computers in secure lab/office environments, typically during working hours. Users may need to respond quickly to errors or system alerts.

**User Journey Summary**: User logs in, reviews system status, monitors logs, configures endpoints or folders, investigates errors, and exports audit trails as needed.

## 3. Information Architecture

**Site/App Structure**:
- Dashboard (system status, quick stats)
- Logs (detailed, filterable)
- Errors/Alerts (active issues, resolution tools)
- Configuration (folders, endpoints, retry settings)
- Audit Trail (exportable history)

**Navigation Strategy**: Persistent left-side or top tabbed navigation for quick switching. Breadcrumbs for sub-pages.

**Content Prioritization**:
- Dashboard: Current status, recent errors, processing stats
- Logs: Chronological, filterable by type/date/result
- Errors: Active issues, resolution actions
- Configuration: Editable settings, validation feedback
- Audit: Export/download options

**User Flow Diagrams**:
- Start at Dashboard → Drill into Logs/Errors → Take action or configure → Return to Dashboard

## 4. Wireframes & Layout Structure

**Screen Layouts**:
- **Dashboard**: Status cards (system health, queue, recent errors), quick actions, summary charts
- **Logs**: Table/grid with filters, search, export
- **Errors/Alerts**: List of active issues, details panel, resolution actions
- **Configuration**: Form-based settings, validation, save/cancel
- **Audit Trail**: Table with export/download

**Content Blocks**: Modular cards, tables, and panels. Key actions (retry, export, edit) are always visible.

**Responsive Behavior**: Optimized for desktop; adapts to large screens. Minimal support for tablets.

**Navigation Elements**: Fixed navigation bar, clear section headers, consistent placement of action buttons.

## 5. Visual Design System

**Color Palette**: GDS-compliant colors (blue, white, grey, green for success, red for errors). High contrast for accessibility.

**Typography**: GDS Transport or Arial, clear hierarchy (large headers, readable body text, monospace for logs).

**Spacing & Grid**: 8px grid, generous whitespace for dense data, clear separation between content blocks.

**Brand Integration**: NHS Wales logo, GDS color and iconography, consistent with NHS digital products.

## 6. UI Component Library

**Form Elements**: Text fields, dropdowns, checkboxes, radio buttons, file pickers, all with clear labels and validation.

**Navigation Components**: Tabs, side nav, breadcrumbs, pagination for logs/audit.

**Content Components**: Cards (status, summary), tables (logs, audit), lists (errors), modals (confirmations), alerts (success/error/info).

**Interactive Elements**: Primary/secondary buttons, links, toggles, retry/export icons.

**Feedback Components**: Loading spinners, inline error messages, success confirmations, toast notifications.

## 7. Page Templates & Patterns

**Homepage/Dashboard**: System health, quick stats, recent errors, quick actions.

**Content Pages**: Logs, errors, audit—each with filter/search/export.

**Form Pages**: Configuration settings, with validation and help text.

**Results/Listing Pages**: Logs and audit trail, paginated and filterable.

**Detail Pages**: Error details, log entry details, configuration summaries.

## 8. Interaction Design & Micro-interactions

**User Actions**: Click/tap for navigation, filter/search, retry, export, edit/save settings.

**System Responses**: Immediate visual feedback (loading, success, error), inline validation, real-time updates for logs/errors.

**Transitions**: Smooth tab/page transitions, animated loading indicators, focus states for accessibility.

**Loading States**: Spinners for data loads, skeleton screens for tables.

**Error Handling**: Prominent error banners, inline error details, clear resolution steps, retry actions.

## 9. Responsive Design Strategy

**Breakpoint Strategy**: Optimized for 1280px+; supports down to 1024px. Minimal adaptation for tablets; not designed for mobile.

**Mobile-First Considerations**: Not prioritized; focus on desktop usability and density.

**Progressive Enhancement**: Core features work in all modern browsers; advanced features degrade gracefully.

**Touch vs. Mouse Interactions**: Mouse/keyboard primary; touch supported for large controls only.

## 10. Accessibility & Inclusive Design

**WCAG Compliance**: Meets or exceeds WCAG 2.2 Level AA and GDS accessibility standards.

**Keyboard Navigation**: All controls accessible via keyboard; visible focus indicators.

**Screen Reader Support**: Proper ARIA roles, labels, and live regions for dynamic content.

**Color Contrast**: All text and UI elements meet 4.5:1 contrast ratio.

**Inclusive Language**: Clear, jargon-free labels and help text; error messages explain resolution steps.

## 11. Design Specifications

**Asset Requirements**: NHS Wales and GDS-compliant icons, SVGs for logos, downloadable CSV for audit/log export.

**Development Handoff**: Annotated wireframes, spacing and sizing specs, color/typography tokens, GDS style guide references.

**Browser Support**: Latest Chrome, Edge, Firefox; fallback for IE11 not required.

**Performance Considerations**: Fast load times, efficient rendering of large tables/logs, async data loading.

**Quality Assurance**: Manual and automated accessibility testing, cross-browser QA, user acceptance testing with lab staff.
